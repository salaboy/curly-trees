# curly-trees
Experiments on Cloud Native statemachines and decision trees in Kubernetes.

The first goal of the experiment is to create a project which shows the following:

1) How to attach a State machine send event to a REST resource event: For example new Author -> Send event E1 to the state machine
2) From a state machine modify a REST resource
3) Verify that the state machine state can be reconstructed based on the events emitted  
4) Understand how to handle external data as JSON
